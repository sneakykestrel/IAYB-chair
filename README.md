# chair

chair,,,

replaces the branch with a familiarly shaped object

you can add a custom hit sound effect by putting any **.ogg** file into the mod's folder and naming it **"hitsfx"**

# Installation

!!! You need [Bepinex 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest) for mono !!!
(if you have no idea what the versions mean try BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.2 and it might work. maybe)

Once bepinex is installed, extract the contents of the zip and put the folder named **"Chair"** into the BepInEx/plugins folder in the game's root directory.

NOTE: Versions < 2.x.x require bepinex 6.0.0-pre2. I don't know why you'd be using an old version but if you are you need to install that instead of bepinex 5

have fun :3
