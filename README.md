# chair

chair,,,

replaces the branch with a familiarly shaped object

you can add a custom hit sound effect by putting any **.ogg** file into the mod's folder and naming it **"hitsfx"**

# Installation

!!! You need [Bepinex 6](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.2) for mono !!!
(if you have no idea what the versions mean try BepInEx-Unity.Mono-win-x64-6.0.0-pre.2 and it might work. maybe)

Once bepinex is installed, extract the contents of the zip and put the folder named **"Chair"** into the BepInEx/plugins folder in the game's root directory.

have fun :3
